            <h2>Doctrine & Covenants 106:4-5</h2>
            <p>4 And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a
                thief in the night—</p>

            <p>5 Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light, and that day shall
                not overtake you as a thief.</p>

            <h2>Matthew 16:13-20</h2>
            <p>13 ¶ When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say
                that I the Son
                of man am?</p>

            <p>14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of
                the
                prophets.</p>

            <p>15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>

            <p>16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>

            <p>17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not
                revealed it unto
                thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</p>

            <p>18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the
                gates
                of hell shall
                not prevail against it.</p>

            <p>19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
                shall be bound
                in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

            <p>Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</p>
